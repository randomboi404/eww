## üì¶ Installation and Usage

Install the dependencies via any of the AUR helper (Paru example below):

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/randomboi404/eww --depth 1
  cd eww
  paru -Syu --needed $(cat dependencies.lst)
```
After then, copy and paste the relevant folders to .config/

Also, create env.json in ~/.env/ and its contents must be as follows:

```bash
   {
        "WEATHER_API_KEY": "Your weather api key",
        "LOCATION": "Your city name"
   }
```

Generate colors based on your wallpaper as shown below:

```bash
   wal -i /path/to/wallpaper
   matugen image /path/to/wallpaper
```

Open eww.scss file and replace the hardcoded @import as per your username.

Run `eww daemon` to load the daemon and then run the following to open the bar and widgets:

```bash
   eww open eww-bar
   eww open bg-panel
   eww open activate-linux
```

Some Hyprland keybinds worth looking:

```
   bind = $mainMod, T, exec, eww update barrev=$( [ "$(eww get barrev)" = "true" ] && echo false || echo true ) && clear
   bind = $mainMod Shift, R, exec, eww update y=$( [ "$(eww get y)" = "true" ] && echo false || echo true ) && eww update x=$( [ "$(eww get x)" = "true" ] && echo false || echo true )
   bind = $mainMod Shift, W, exec, $HOME/.config/hypr/scripts/dock.sh
```

where, dock.sh is as follows:
```bash
    #!/usr/bin/bash
    pkill -9 -f "$HOME/.config/eww/dock/scripts/toggle-dock.sh" || true
    "$HOME/.config/eww/dock/scripts/toggle-dock.sh"
```
    
## ‚ùì FAQ

### The alignment looks wrong / broken.

Make sure you are using eww-git from AUR (for Arch linux) and NOT the eww package from repos.

### There are no notifications.
Make sure that the end-rs bin is running in background. It is available either in .config/eww/bin OR see the instructions of the [official repo](https://github.com/Dr-42/end-rs). Also make sure that you have copied end-rs folder to .config/ as well.

### Everything is transparent, no colors.

Ensure Pywal is installed and applied to your wallpaper:
```bash
wal -i /path/to/wallpaper/
```
